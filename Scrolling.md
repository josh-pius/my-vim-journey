### Scrolling
- `H,M,L` To move to High, Middle and Low of the screen
- `zt,zz,zb` Does not move the cursor but are used to control the positioning of the screen relative to the line where the cursor is located
- `Ctrl + U / Ctrl + D` to move half screen up and down
- `Ctrl + B / Ctrl + F` to move a full screen up or down
- `Ctrl + Y / Ctrl + E` - Used to scroll the text in the window without moving the cursor (Seems pretty useful)
